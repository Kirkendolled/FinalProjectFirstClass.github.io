# FinalProjectFirstClass.github.io
This was a project I completed with my first class on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Our main focus was properly managing the web page components using the JavaScript DOM API.
Creating containers using the DIV tags and using CSS to rearrange and resize the content. 
We also used media queries to resize the screen and its components depending on the user's screen.
This project was a good basis for learning how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together.
